# Contributing to Orchestra

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orchestra! This document provides guidelines for contributing.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/songyinggoh/Orchestra.git
cd orchestra

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests (recommended for quick local validation)
pytest tests/unit/ -x -q

# Run unit tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=orchestra --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_state.py -v
```

> **Note:** Running `pytest tests/` without a subdirectory will execute ALL tests
> including integration, live, and load tests, which require external services
> (Postgres, Redis, NATS, etc.). Use `pytest tests/unit/` for quick local
> validation. Also note that `[dev]` extras do not include `locust` or `hypothesis`;
> those are in `[test-advanced]`.
